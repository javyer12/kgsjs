# KGS.js

Whenever I start a new project, I don't know what to write for the first commit. After doing a “git init” there is technically nothing there...

-----KGS provides you with a list of examples that you can use in your commits.-----

## Install

```npm
npm install -g kgs
```

# Usage

```bash
 Commands:

    kgs -l error
    # Print the errors list.

    kgs -l sucess
    # Print the successes list.

    kgs error
    #Run an errors list of commits to pick one

    kgs success
    # Run an successes list of commits to pick one
```
